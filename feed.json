We help good technology, and good technology companies, become great. (And yes, all companies are technology companies today. Yours too!) But HG Consulting also knows that not all problems require a new technical solution. In fact, sometimes removing features has a larger impact than adding another! Sometimes just explaining \"why\"​ is the silver bullet.</p>\n<p>Good companies manage Engineering. Great companies manage Product.</p>\n<p>We deliver products and product delivery solutions that MAKE THE USER AWESOME at what they do because we provide elegant solutions to complex problems. Traditional systems (and traditional solutions) became complicated over time - many moving parts - but they still followed the rules - complicated systems are still predictable (a.k.a. deterministic). Today, however, systems and solutions have become COMPLEX, and there is a big difference! Traditional management of a new complex system just does not work because complex systems exhibit \"sensitive dependence on initial conditions,\"​ which means that they are no longer predictable.</p>\n<dl class=\"overflow-hidden\">\n<dt class=\"org-page-details__definition-term t-14 t-black t-bold\">Arizona State Corporation Comission</dt>\n<dd class=\"org-page-details__definition-text t-14 t-black--light t-normal\"><span class=\"link-without-visited-state\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://ecorp.azcc.gov/BusinessSearch/BusinessInfo?entityNumber=L09762111\">https://ecorp.azcc.gov/BusinessSearch/BusinessInfo?entityNumber=L09762111</a><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ecorp.azcc.gov/BusinessSearch/BusinessInfo?entityNumber=L09762111\" id=\"ember362\" class=\"link-without-visited-state ember-view\" tabindex=\"0\"></a></span></dd>\n</dl>\n<p class=\"align-right\"><a href=\"https://lukemaze.github.io/lukemaze.github.io\">Return to Home</a></p>",
